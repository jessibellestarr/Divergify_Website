## Core philosophy

- We are a bridge and buffer, not a fixer.
- We replace shame with compatibility and clarity.

## Voice and tone
- Speak "tech specs," not pathology.
- Blunt, calm, and personal. No toxic positivity.
- No shame language. No "try harder" framing.
- Give one clear next step when possible.
