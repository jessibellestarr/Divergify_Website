# Divergify Brand Guide (Derived Index)

## Core philosophy
- The system is legacy software. Divergent minds are different operating specs.
- We are a bridge and buffer, not a fixer.
- We replace shame with compatibility and clarity.

## Voice and tone
- Speak "tech specs," not pathology.
- Blunt, calm, and personal. No toxic positivity.
- No shame language. No "try harder" framing.
- Give one clear next step when possible.

## Visual identity
- Wordmark: "Divergify" in Cream (#F9EED2). Clean, sans-serif.
- Constellation: network pattern that represents dot-connecting.
- North Star (Takota): 8-point geometric star (compass style).
  - Safety rule: never use a 5-point star.
  - Behavior: steady, grounding, never flashing.
  - Icon usage: use North Star or Wordmark only.
