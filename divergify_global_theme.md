# Divergify Global Theme

This is the single source of truth for the Divergify look and feel across:

- Main site (Netlify)
- Shopify store theme

## Brand principles

- Calm, readable, low interference by default
- No neon, no black backgrounds
- Navy base with softened accents
- Consistency across web, app, merch

## Colors

- Primary Navy: #1B2559
- Muted Blue:  #5B8FA8
- Soft Lime:   #8FAF8A
- Action Green: #6FAE86
- Text Light:  #FFFFFF
- Text Muted:  #D7E1EC

## Modes

- Default
- Reduced interference (Shades): no animations, lower visual noise
- Tin Foil Hat Mode: tracking and external calls off by default

## Navigation

Header tabs left to right:

Divergify, The Hub, Field Notes, Dopamine Depot, Divergipedia, Contact

No extra links. No Home link. No emojis.

## Header rules

- Wordmark only
- No icon in header
- Always show the two toggles: Tin Foil Hat and Shades

## Footer rules

- Socials: Instagram, TikTok, Email
- Support link
- Legal line with copyright and disclaimer
- One rotating easter egg line per page load

## Files

- Website CSS lives in `02_WEBSITE_ACTIVE/assets/global.css`
- Website runtime lives in `02_WEBSITE_ACTIVE/assets/site.js`
- Header and footer partials live in `02_WEBSITE_ACTIVE/partials/`

Edit those partials. Do not duplicate the header and footer into individual pages.
