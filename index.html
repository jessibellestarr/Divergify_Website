    <p class="text-muted">
      Divergify is built for people whose minds move fast, scan constantly, and refuse to stay inside neat little boxes.
      When a system is rigid, it does not make you stronger. It makes you spend your intelligence on surviving the system.
      We build the opposite: structure that respects cognition, protects the nervous system, and turns intention into motion.
    </p>

    <p class="text-muted">
      The psychology is not mysterious. People avoid tasks when the task feels unsafe, vague, socially risky, or too big to hold.
      So we lower ambiguity, reduce friction, and create clear exit ramps. You do not need to be fixed. You need a plan that matches reality.
    </p>

    <p class="text-muted">
      The brand is “Divergified.” That means professional, calm, and well researched, with a controlled streak of humor that signals
      you are not alone. Easter eggs are deliberate. Nothing screams. Nothing manipulates. Consent is the feature.

      If you feel stuck, that is not a moral failure. It is a signal. We treat signals like data, then we design around them.

    <h3>What this is</h3>
    <p class="text-muted">
      A calm website, a behavior heavy system, and an app build that is meant to ship. The Hub organizes execution.
      Divergipedia names patterns. Dopamine Depot supports the mission without turning you into the product.

    <p class="text-muted">
      Two modes live in the header because reality changes. Shades reduces interference when your brain is overloaded.
      Tin Foil Hat Mode exists because privacy should not require trust, it should require controls.
