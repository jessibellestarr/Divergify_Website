        <h1 class="hero-title">Divergify</h1>
        <p class="hero-tagline">For brains that zig when the world zags.</p>
        <p class="kicker">A place built for minds that run a little out of sync.</p>
        <p class="text-muted">This is a home base for neurodivergent brains who are tired of being treated like a problem.</p>
        <p class="text-muted">We use behavioral science and neurodivergent research to reduce friction and protect your attention.</p>
        <p class="text-muted">No shame. No hacks. Just better conditions.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Welcome home</h2>
      <p>Most systems were designed for consistency, compliance, and linear focus.</p>
      <p>If you think in patterns, jump between contexts, or run hot and then crash, you are not broken.</p>
      <p>You are running different specs inside an outdated system.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What we are building</h2>
      <p>Divergify is an environment that supports execution without forcing you to mask.</p>
      <p>We design for the real costs of attention, working memory, and emotional load.</p>
      <p>That means smaller steps, clearer scaffolding, and fewer triggers.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Why this structure works</h2>
      <p>Neurodivergent attention follows relevance, safety, and capacity.</p>
      <p>When a task feels unclear or costly, the brain protects itself by slowing down or disengaging.</p>
      <p>The fix is not pressure. It is better conditions.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What you can expect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Calm, predictable design.</li>
        <li>Local first defaults with privacy built in.</li>
        <li>Support that preserves your autonomy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This isn’t productivity theater. It’s a workspace for competence.</p>

  <section class="section">
    <p>Divergify supports effort. It doesn’t replace it.</p>
    <p>We don’t use shame, manipulation, surveillance, artificial urgency, or deceit to force output.</p>
    <p>We strive to reduce unnecessary friction and support thinking when it falters.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Who this is for</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>People who think in systems, not steps.</li>
      <li>People who do well in complexity but stall in rigid workflows.</li>
      <li>People who deal with executive dysfunction, RSD, or hyperfocus and are tired of pretending those aren’t factors.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>If this feels familiar, you already know why.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>The stance</h2>
    <p>No attention extraction.</p>
    <p>No data selling.</p>
    <p>No shame loops.</p>
    <p>Built deliberately. Not loudly. Not desperately.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>Build tools that honor neurodivergent reality and reduce the daily cost of functioning.</p>
    <p>Stability before speed. Clarity before noise. Care before compliance.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>As you explore</h2>
    <p>Divergify is intentionally layered. Some things are meant to be experienced first, not explained all at once.</p>
    <p>You don’t need the full theory to use the system. Deeper context exists for those who want it.</p>
    <p>Questions tend to surface after real use. When they do, feedback helps shape what gets built next.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>What lives where</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Hub</strong> is the working environment. This is where the MVP lives.</li>
      <li><strong>Field Notes</strong> contains long form thinking, research, and design rationale.</li>
      <li><strong>Divergipedia</strong> is shared language for patterns that deserve names.</li>
      <li><strong>Dopamine Depot</strong> is the store that helps fund continued development.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-muted">Nothing here is mandatory. Use what helps. Ignore what doesn’t.</p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Start here</h2>
    <p>There is no required order.</p>
    <p>Begin where your capacity allows.</p>
