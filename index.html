        <h1 class="hero-title">Divergify</h1>
        <p class="kicker">A place built for minds that run a little out of sync.</p>
        <p class="text-muted">This is a home base for neurodivergent brains who are tired of being treated like a problem.</p>
        <p class="text-muted">We use behavioral science and neurodivergent research to reduce friction and protect your attention.</p>
        <p class="text-muted">No shame. No hacks. Just a calmer environment and tools that meet you where you are.</p>
      </div>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Welcome home</h2>
      <p>Most systems were designed for consistency, compliance, and linear focus.</p>
      <p>If you think in patterns, jump between contexts, or run hot and then crash, you are not broken.</p>
      <p>You are running different specs inside a system that never updated.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What we build</h2>
      <p>Divergify is an environment that supports execution without forcing you to mask.</p>
      <p>We design for the real costs of attention, working memory, and emotional load.</p>
      <p>That means smaller steps, clearer scaffolding, and fewer triggers.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Why this structure works</h2>
      <p>Neurodivergent attention follows relevance, novelty, and safety. When a task feels unclear or costly, the brain protects itself by drifting or shutting down.</p>
      <p>Research on ADHD, autism, and trauma shows that executive load rises fast when expectations outpace capacity. The fix is not willpower. It is better conditions.</p>
      <p>We build those conditions: clearer cues, smaller steps, reduced sensory noise, and permission to recalibrate.</p>
      <p class="text-muted" style="font-size: 0.9rem;">If you want deeper context, most of it lives in Field Notes.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What you can expect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Calm, predictable design.</li>
        <li>Local‑first defaults with privacy built in.</li>
        <li>Support that respects your autonomy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This isn’t productivity theater. It’s a workspace for competence.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>A line we won’t cross</h2>
      <p>Divergify supports effort. It doesn’t replace it.</p>
      <p>We won’t use shame, manipulation, or surveillance to force output.</p>
      <p>Remove the friction. Let intelligence do its job.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Who this is for</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>People who think in systems, not steps.</li>
        <li>People who do well in complexity but stall in rigid workflows.</li>
        <li>People who want support without being talked down to.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If this feels familiar, you already know why.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>The stance</h2>
      <p>No attention extraction.</p>
      <p>No data selling.</p>
      <p>No shame loops.</p>
      <p>Built deliberately. Not loudly. Not desperately.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>Build tools that honor neurodivergent reality and reduce the daily cost of functioning.</p>
      <p>Stability before speed. Clarity before noise. Care before compliance.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Start here</h2>
      <p>Most of the deeper context lives in Field Notes.</p>
      <p>When you’re ready, the Hub is waiting in the nav.</p>
