    <h1>Healthy Momentum?</h1>
    <div class="field-notes-body">
      <p>I’ve been thinking about how often people confuse momentum with the health of a system.</p>
      <p>Things can be moving. Busy. Productive. Loud.</p>
      <p>And still be quietly wrong.</p>
      <p>There’s a difference between motion that’s alive and motion that’s just inertia wearing a better outfit.</p>
      <p>One feels expansive. The other feels like “a fat guy in a little coat.”</p>
      <p>(if this means nothing to you, here’s the visual. you’re welcome.)</p>
      <p>Still moving.</p>
      <p>Still smiling.</p>
      <p>Still insisting that this is fine.</p>
      <p>But everyone can see it’s uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>Most systems don’t care about that part. As long as you keep moving, nobody asks whether you can breathe. Whether your shoulders are jammed up around your ears. Whether the thing you’ve outgrown is now just clinging to you out of habit.</p>
      <p>That’s usually when people are told to accept it.</p>
      <p>To adapt.</p>
      <p>To stop making it a thing.</p>
      <p>It’s just how it is.</p>
      <p>Which is wild, because your body knows the difference immediately. Your mind does too. We just get very good at ignoring the signal once questioning it starts coming with consequences.</p>
